Ridership does not include passengers who exit the subway or passengers who transfer from other subway lines, with the exception of out-of-system transfers; e.g., between the Lexington Av/63 St F subwaystation and the Lexington Avenue N subwayQ subwayR subway/59 St4 subway5 subway6 subwaystation, where customers use their MetroCard to make the transfer.\n",
