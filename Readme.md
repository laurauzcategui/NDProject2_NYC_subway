# Background Information

Subway ridership consists of all passengers (other than NYC Transit employees) who enter the subway system, including passengers who transfer from buses.  Ridership does not include passengers who exit the subway or passengers who transfer from other subway lines, with the exception of out-of-system transfers; e.g., between the Lexington Av/63 St F subwaystation and the Lexington Avenue N subwayQ subwayR subway/59 St4 subway5 subway6 subwaystation, where customers use their MetroCard to make the transfer.

This project has the purpose to analyze and investigate if more people ride the Subway when is raining vs when it is not raining.
